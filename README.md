Diabetes Health Project
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description of the project: The Diabetes Data Analysis project aims to use machine learning techniques to analyze health data and discover the factors influencing the development of diabetes. The project relies on a dataset containing health information such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, cholesterol levels, lifestyle, and family history to build a predictive model that aids in early diagnosis of the disease.

Project motivation: Diabetes is a widespread chronic disease, and early detection is crucial to prevent severe complications like heart disease and kidney failure. The project aims to use data analysis techniques to identify the factors that contribute to the development of diabetes, thus providing a useful tool for doctors in early diagnosis and treatment decisions.
